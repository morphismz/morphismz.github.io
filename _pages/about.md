I graduated *summa cum laude* from the University of Colorado Boulder in Summer 2023 with a B.A. in mathematics and philosophy. I am currently working in Colorado as a mathematics tutor while continuing to study math and philosophy in my free time. I also enjoy baking and confection making. This site will serve to detail my exploits in both of these things :) (though mostly it will be about academic stuff)

Mathematics
======
My interests in mathematics include higher category theory, homotopy theory, the foundations of mathematics, and bringing these subjects closer together. I am particularly interested by synthetic approaches to higher category theory and homotopy theory. I like univalent and structural approaches to the foundations of mathematics and I hope to help advance their prominence in the mathematical community by helping to developing mathematics in the language of book HoTT.

I succesfully defended my honors thesis in Spring 2023, which was written under the direction of [Professor Jonathan Wise](http://math.colorado.edu/~jonathan.wise/index.html). The title of the thesis is *Eckmann-Hilton and The Hopf Fibration in Homotopy Type Theory*. In the thesis I develop an elementary proof in the language of book HoTT demonstrating that the Eckmann-Hilton argument can be used to construct a generator of $\pi_3(\mathbb{S^2})$. I presented the results of this thesis at the [Carnegie Mellon University's Internation Confrence of Homotopy Type Theory 2023](https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2023/). More details about the thesis (and, at some point or another, a write up of the results) can be found [here](https://morphismz.github.io/publications/2023-03-01-eh-and-hopf).

I also like coding up mathematics when I get the chance. I am a contributor of the agda-unimath repository. Ultimately I aim to formalize the results of my honors thesis using the agda-unimath library.

Philosophy
======
In my junior and senior year at CU, I was president of the [CU Boulder Undergraduate Philosophy Club](https://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/events/undergraduate-philosophy-club).

My interests in philosophy are primarily in metaphysics, philosophy of language, and the philosophy of mathematics. My favorite philosophical text is Saul Kripke's *Naming and Necessity*.

Baking and Confection Making
======
My interests in baking and confection making are wide ranging, ranging as wide as time permits :) I started baking around the age of fourteen and have continued enjoying tasty, fresh bread since then. I took up basic confection making during The Pandemic and have tried to make confections any chance I get, though its a lot harder to find the time (confection recipes are... more involved). 

I like adapting commercial yeast recipes to sourdough recipies. I will post certain recipes under the Baking page.
