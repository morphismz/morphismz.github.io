I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Colorado, Boulder with a bachelors of arts in mathematics and in philosophy. For my honors, I defendended a thesis in the mathematics department titled “Eckmann-Hilton and the Hopf Fibration in Homotopy Type Theory”. I subsequently presented the results of my thesis at the [Second International Conference on Homotopy Type Theory](https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2023/) at Carnegie Mellon University.

Within mathematics, I have an interest in higher category theory and homotopy theory, in type theory and the foundations of math, and in connections between these subjects and computer science. In particular, I am fascinated by functional programming and the formal verification of proofs and programs. As an application of this, I am a contributor to the [agda-unimath repository](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/), a collaborative and sprawling formal verification project written in Agda, a dependently typed pure functional programming language.


Mathematics
======
My interests in mathematics include higher category theory and homotopy theory, the foundations of mathematics and formal verification, as well as bringing these subjects closer together. I am particularly interested by synthetic approaches to higher category theory and homotopy theory. I favor univalent approaches to the foundations of mathematics and I hope to help advance their prominence in the mathematical community by developing mathematics Homotopy Type Theory.

I succesfully defended my honors thesis in Spring 2023, which was written under the direction of [Professor Jonathan Wise](http://math.colorado.edu/~jonathan.wise/index.html). The title of the thesis is *Eckmann-Hilton and The Hopf Fibration in Homotopy Type Theory*. In the thesis I develop an elementary proof in the language of book HoTT demonstrating that the Eckmann-Hilton argument can be used to construct a generator of $\pi_3(\mathbb{S^2})$. I presented the results of this thesis at the [Carnegie Mellon University's Internation Confrence of Homotopy Type Theory 2023](https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2023/).

Philosophy
======
In my junior and senior year at CU, I was president of the [CU Boulder Undergraduate Philosophy Club](https://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/events/undergraduate-philosophy-club). As president I worked to schedule intersting events and speakers as well as make the philosophy club a more inclusive enviroment.

My interests in philosophy are primarily in metaphysics, philosophy of language, and the philosophy of mathematics. My favorite philosophical text is Saul Kripke's *Naming and Necessity*.
