I graduated summa cum laude from the University of Colorado, Boulder with a bachelors of arts in mathematics and in philosophy. For my honors, I defendended a thesis in the mathematics department titled “Eckmann-Hilton and the Hopf Fibration in Homotopy Type Theory”. I subsequently presented the results of my thesis at the [Second International Conference on Homotopy Type Theory](https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2023/) at Carnegie Mellon University.

Within mathematics, I have an interest in higher category theory and homotopy theory, in type theory and the foundations of math, and in connections between these subjects and computer science. In particular, I am fascinated by functional programming and the formal verification of proofs and programs. As an application of this, I am a contributor to the [agda-unimath repository](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/), a collaborative and sprawling formal verification project written in Agda, a dependently typed pure functional programming language.


Mathematics
======
My interests in mathematics include higher category theory and homotopy theory, the foundations of mathematics and formal verification, as well as bringing these subjects closer together. I am particularly interested by synthetic approaches to higher category theory and homotopy theory. I favor univalent approaches to the foundations of mathematics and I hope to help advance their prominence in the mathematical community by developing mathematics in Homotopy Type Theory.

I succesfully defended my honors thesis in Spring 2023, which was written under the direction of [Professor Jonathan Wise](http://math.colorado.edu/~jonathan.wise/index.html). The title of the thesis is *Eckmann-Hilton and The Hopf Fibration in Homotopy Type Theory*. In the thesis I develop an elementary proof in the language of book HoTT demonstrating that the Eckmann-Hilton argument can be used to construct a generator of $\pi_3(\mathbb{S^2})$. I presented the results of this thesis at the [Carnegie Mellon University's Internation Confrence of Homotopy Type Theory 2023](https://hott.github.io/HoTT-2023/). I am currently working to formalize the results of my thesis. For more on this, please see the following [page](https://morphismz.github.io/projects/2023-eh-hopf).

agda-unimath
======
I am a contributor to the [agda-unimath repository](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/) repository, a large-cale (250K loc) formal verification project that aims to "create an online encyclopedia of formalized mathematics containing an extensive curriculum of topics from a univalent point of view." A full acount of my contributions can be found [here](https://github.com/UniMath/agda-unimath/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+author%3Amorphismz). Here a some selected contributions:

- Higher coherence theorems: Identifications (terms of the intensional identity type) behave like isomorphisms in an $\infty$-groupoid. They are thus subject to an infinite tower of coherences. I have formalized some coherences on 2-dimensional identifications, including [unit laws](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/foundation.path-algebra.html#7502) and [inverse laws](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/foundation.path-algebra.html#8603). Further contributions in this vein include the action on [2-dimensional identifications of a function](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/foundation.path-algebra.html#11341) and [related coherences](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/foundation.path-algebra.html#11645).

- Suspension of a type: The homotopy theoretic construction of suspension can be defined internal to the type system of Agda. I have helped to formalize some propreties of the suspension of a type, including [a characterization of identifications in the type of suspension structures](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/synthetic-homotopy-theory.suspensions-of-types.html#4783), a [proof suspsensions have the universal property excpected of them](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/synthetic-homotopy-theory.suspensions-of-types.html#11043), definitions of [the unit and counit of the suspension loop space adjunction](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/synthetic-homotopy-theory.suspensions-of-types.html#15436), and the [equivalence of the suspension loop space adjunction](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/synthetic-homotopy-theory.suspensions-of-types.html#18007).

I am curruently working on formalizing the main results of my honors thesis using the agda-unimath library. You can read more about this project [here](https://morphismz.github.io/projects/2023-eh-hopf). 

Philosophy
======
In my junior and senior year at CU, I was president of the [CU Boulder Undergraduate Philosophy Club](https://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/events/undergraduate-philosophy-club). As president I worked to schedule intersting events and speakers as well as make the philosophy club a more inclusive enviroment.

My interests in philosophy are primarily in metaphysics, philosophy of language, and the philosophy of mathematics. My favorite philosophical text is Saul Kripke's *Naming and Necessity*.

Teaching and Tutoring
======
I have over three years of teaching and tutoring experience, including experience with private tutoring, leading in person classes of up to 30 students, and more. I am currently working as a private tutor in the greater Boulder area, serving student both locally and online. If you or someone you know is interested in tutoring services, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can find my email in the sidebar.

I subscribe to an active learing philosophy, focusing on giving students the tools to take the learning process into their own hands and make it an enjoyable experience. I help students build problem solving skills, hone abstract reasoning ability, and practice critical thinking techniques. I have experience teaching and tutoring a wide range of mathematics cirriculum, including advanced college mathematics.
