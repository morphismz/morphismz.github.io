I have been working towards formalizing the results of my honors thesis, "Eckmann-Hilton and the Hopf Fibration in Homotopy Type Theory". The formalization is taking place in the [agda-unimath library](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/).

For a current version of the proof, please see my [HoTT/UF-2024 talk](https://morphismz.github.io/talks/2024-04-03-hottuf)
