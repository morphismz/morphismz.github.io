I have been working towards formalizing the results of my honors thesis, "Eckmann-Hilton and the Hopf Fibration in Homotopy Type Theory". I aim to have this fully formalized by the end of 2023, or early 2024. The formalization uses the [agda-unimath library](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/).

Since defending the thesis, and presenting the results at HoTT-2023, I have made some conceptual simplifications to the proof. So I'll include here an outline of the current proof. You can also download this outline as a [pdf](https://morphismz.github.io/files/2023-eh-hopf.pdf).
