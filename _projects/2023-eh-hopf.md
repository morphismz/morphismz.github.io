I have been working towards formalizing the results of my honors thesis, "Eckmann-Hilton and the Hopf Fibration in Homotopy Type Theory". I aim to have this fully formalized by the end of 2023, or early 2024. The formalization uses the [agda-unimath library](https://unimath.github.io/agda-unimath/).

Since defending the thesis, and presenting the results at HoTT-2023, I have made some conceptual simplifications to the proof. So I'll include here an outline of the current proof. The main idea of the proof remains the same: the connection between Eckmann-Hilton and the Hopf fibration is found in the naturality condition of 2-dimensional operations on 2-paths. Please see the following pdf for the full summary: [2023-eh-hopf.pdf](https://morphismz.github.io/files/2023-eh-hopf.pdf). Please note, this document's current serves as notes to myself and as an outline for the formalization project. Thus, keep in mind two things: (i) this document is not fully completed, so should be looked at as a partial description, and (ii) this document is not meant to be an introduction to the problem, but only an update for those famliar with the topics.
