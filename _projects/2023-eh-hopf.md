title: "Formalizing Eckmann-Hilton and the Hopf Fibration in Homotopy Type Theory"

I have been working towards formalizing the results of my honors thesis, "Eckmann-Hilton and the Hopf Fibration in Homotopy Type Theory". I aim to have this fully formalized and incoperated into the agda-unimath library by the end of 2023, or early 2024. On this page I will outline my plan and post updates on my progress.

Since defending the thesis, and presenting the results at HoTT-2023, I have made some conceptual simplifications to the proof. So I'll include here an outline of the current proof. [To be posted soon]
