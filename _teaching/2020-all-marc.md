From October 2020 (my sophmore year at CU) untill May 2023 (my final semester at CU), I worked as a tutor at the CU Boulder Mathematics academic resource center. I helped students on a drop in basis. I helped with material ranging from Calculus I-III to Linear Algbra, Discrete Math, and Abstract Algebra.
