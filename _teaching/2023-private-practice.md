I have over three years of teaching and tutoring experience, including private tutoring and leading in person classes of around 25 students. I am currently working as a private tutor in the greater Boulder area and online. If you or someone you know is interested in tutoring services, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can find my email in the sidebar.

I subscribe to an active learing philosophy, focusing on giving students the tools to take learing process into their own hands and make it an enjoyable experience. I help students build problem solving skills, hone abstract reasoning ability, and practice critical thinking techniques. I have experience teaching and tutoring a wide range of mathematics cirriculum, including advanced college mathematics.
