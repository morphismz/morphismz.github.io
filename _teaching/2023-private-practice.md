I have over three years of teaching and tutoring experience, including experience with private tutoring, leading in-person classes of up to 30 students, and more. I am currently working as a private tutor in the greater Boulder area, serving student both locally and online. If you or someone you know is interested in tutoring services, please don't hesitate to reach out. You can find my email in the sidebar.

I subscribe to an active learing philosophy, focusing on giving students the tools to take the learning process into their own hands and make it an enjoyable experience. I help students build problem solving skills, hone abstract reasoning ability, and practice critical thinking techniques. I have experience teaching and tutoring a wide range of mathematics cirriculum, covering everything from middle school level to advanced college mathematics.
