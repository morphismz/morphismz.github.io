During the 2023-2024 school year, I served as the lead mathematics instructor at Temple Grandin School, serving students with Asperger's Syndrome and similar learning profiles. My duties including planning and constructing curriculum, leading three classes of highschool and middle school mathematics, and assessing student growth.
